# SQL-Challenge

In this challenge, employee data from the 1980s and 1990s from company Pewlett Hackard was engineered and analyzed using SQL. Six CSV files with various information including names, employee numbers, dates of hire, and salaries were read into PG Admin and queries executed to retrieve the requested information. 

A diagram demonstrates how each CSV relates to each other via primary and foreign keys. 

Further exploration was conducted in Jupyter Notebook using a direct connection to the SQL database, and the data was found to be fabricated based on information in this notebook. Salary and job titles did not make sense together, and "our" employee number was found to belong to an employee named "April Foolsday".
